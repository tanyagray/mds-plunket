                Fathers play a key role in giving children the best start in life 
                and Plunket sends best Father's Day wishes to all fathers across

                their partners and involved in their child's development. It helps when dads

                seek help if necessary. Thanks dads! Happy Fathers Day!!"</span>

                Traditionally, the mother has been seen as the primary caregiver and this has 
                resulted in many services over the years being directed at women. However, more 
                and more fathers are taking on the role of primary caregiver and more support is 
                being developed for them in this role. Plunket recognises the diversity in New 
                Zealand families and sees that many fathers want to have more direct involvement 
                in raising their children. Through Plunket and other organisations, fathers are 
                now involved with parent education programmes, coffee groups and volunteer committees.

                Some practical ways a father could help a new mother include:<br />
                - Taking an active role in caring for the baby, bathing, changing, holding, singing or reading to and comforting baby <br />
                - Taking baby for a walk so that the mother can have a rest <br />
                - Talking and finding ways to solve problems together <br />
                - Supporting the mother's decision to breastfeed <br />
